this is an example of what will be returned when a GET request is made to:
localhost:8080/profile/lelo
(lelo is a param)
{
    "_id": "661f3241d1a87f3f7b938539",
    "displayName": "lelo",
    "username": "661f3241d1a87f3f7b938537",
    "videos": [
        "661f350c120798b2debfddce"
    ],
    "points": 0,
    "savedSkills": [],
    "__v": 0
}

=====> im thinking that we probably need to work on getting you the url for the videos instead of the id number....

if you want to save a video this is what the backend is lookign for
a POST request to
localhost:8080/savedSkills/lelo

(lelo can be replaced with any user name)

with a body with these properties: { url, title, subject }
